**Student_Database**

* This project is mainly for improving on my C++ knowledge. 

* It's supposed to be an admission system that admits students based on their qualifications.

* Download this project using `$ git clone https://github.com/lil-brumski/Student_Database.git` inside any working terminal/command line.

* `$ cd Student_Database/`

* `$ mkdir build/`

* `$ cd build/`

* `$ cmake ..`

* `$ make`

* `$ chmod +x student.o`

* `$ ./student.o`

* An `admission-list.txt` file will be automatically created. This file contains the admission list.
